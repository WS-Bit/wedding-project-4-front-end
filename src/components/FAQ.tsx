        question: "What are you guys doing for gifts?",
        answer: "Your presence at our wedding is the greatest gift we could ask for. Should you wish to honor us with a gift, a contribution to our future home together would be greatly appreciated. There is a link to our gift registry on the home screen."
    },
    {
        question: "What are the transport options in Australia?",
        answer: "For the Australian wedding, getting to the venue should be accessible by lots of modes of transport as it is very central. There is parking at the Grounds and also a few multistory car parks nearby. You can view detailed parking information by clicking here: [parking guide](/assets/parking.pdf). If you have any questions, please let us know."
    },
    {
        question: "What are the transport options in England?",
        answer: " For the English celebration, we are considering hiring transport that will potentially go from Marlborough/Pewsey to Wilcot. If this is something you would be interested in, please let us know. If driving, we could advise not to drive down the church as it's down a small lane, and to park more centrally in the village and walk down. As it's a small village as a whole, there isn't much space for lots of cars so car shares or arranging transport is advised."
